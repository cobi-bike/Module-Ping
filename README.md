## üöÄ Installation and Setup

You can easily deploy the app on you own:

### Step 1: Clone repository

Clone this repository and install Node.js dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```  

### Step 2: Install COBI.bike DevKit

Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/cobi-bike/DevKit#-test-your-module) to install the COBI.bike Google Chrome Simulator and get familiar with the basics of app development on the COBI plattform.

### Step 3: Create a twilio account

This app relies on [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/) to send custom SMS from the Node.js backend. Create an account, setup ¬ªProgrammable SMS¬´ and retrieve your api credentials. For testing purposes consider using test credentials found in the General Settings.

### Step 4: Edit configuration file

Rename `config.js.EXAMPLE` in the root directory to `config.js` and fill in your twilio credentials. 

### Step 5: Run Node.js server

The app is accessible under [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/) after starting the Node.js server with:
```bash
PORT=8888 node server.js
```

### Debugging Tips & Tricks

* For seing javascript errors in the native App, activate the "Show module errors" option in the "Diagnostics" section
* To get better error messages when interacting with the `COBI.js` API, include `https://cdn.cobi.bike/cobi.js/0.34.1/cobi.dev.js` instead of the script mentioned above (**please note:** the dev version is considerably larger which has a big impact on the loading time)
* To show a native dialog when running inside the iOS App, just use a normal `alert("your messages")` (only for debugging)
* When developing in Chrome, use the phone button in the upper left corner of the Chrome Developer Tools and rotate it to landscape to see how it looks while riding 
* When using the Chrome Simulator, press the `Print state to console` button to print the current `COBI.js` state to the Chrome Developer Tools Console
